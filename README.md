# Zero to Mastery Deep Learning with Tensorflow Course

This repo contains all the course materials, notes and exercices I have written during the [Zero to Mastery Deep Learning with Tensorflow course](https://zerotomastery.io/courses/learn-tensorflow/)

## Course Notebooks

### Appendix

- Introduction to Pandas for Data Analysis
- Intoduction to Numpy

Exercises are based off (and directly taken from) the quick introduction to pandas notebook and numpy notebook.
